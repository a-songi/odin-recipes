   <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A vegan rice noodle base with marinated tofu and vegetables. I like to also serve it with vegan chili-mayo, but it tastes great without as well.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ (16 ounce) package dried rice noodles</li>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) package firm tofu, cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, cubed</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh green beans, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>sesame seeds, or to taste</li>

    </ul>

        <br>
        <li>Combine tofu, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon coconut oil, teriyaki sauce, 1/2 of the garlic, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper in a bowl and set aside while preparing the rest of the ingredients.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a large skillet over low heat and cook the remaining garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add bell pepper and green beans and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.<br> Remove tofu from marinade and add to vegetables. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and mix well. Season with vegetable seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir-fry for 2 minutes. Cover and cook for 3 minutes. Add drained noodles and stir to combine.</li>
